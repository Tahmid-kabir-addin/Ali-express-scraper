I recently used this Universal Adapter on an international trip that spanned the UK, Europe, Asia, and India, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. Its compact design made it incredibly easy to pack and carry around, which is a huge plus for frequent travelers like myself.Versatile CompatibilityOne of the standout features of this adapter is its universal compatibility. No matter where I was, I could effortlessly plug in my devices. The adapter’s ability to fit different socket types across multiple regions was a lifesaver, eliminating the need to carry multiple adapters.This adapter goes beyond just fitting into various outlets. It allows you to charge up to six devices simultaneously at high speed, thanks to its 4 USB-A ports (2.4A), 1 USB-C port (3A), and 1 AC socket. This was incredibly convenient for keeping my iPhone, laptop, tablet, power bank, camera, and headset charged and ready to go. The high-speed charging ensured that all my devices were juiced up quickly, saving me a lot of time.Safety CertifiedSafety is always a concern when using travel adapters especially when traveling overseas with voltage fluctuations being a thing. This one is equipped with all the necessary safety features. It has a built-in 8A fuse, safety shutters, and a plug lock system to ensure secure connections. Additionally, it’s certified by RoHS, CE, and FCC, giving me peace of mind that my devices were protected.Overall ExperienceIn summary, the Universal Adapter is a must-have for any international traveler. Its compact design, versatile compatibility, multiple charging ports, and top-notch safety features make it an essential travel accessory. It made my trip so much easier and more convenient, and I highly recommend it to anyone who travels frequently.
This international wall charger is incredibly versatile, working seamlessly in multiple countries with different plug types. The built-in USB ports allow for easy charging of multiple devices at once, which is extremely convenient. It's compact, lightweight, and the quality feels robust and reliable. The adapter also comes with a handy travel pouch, making it easy to carry.
We used this on our trip to London and Paris. Worked wonderful! We used it in the airports and in the hotels. Portable and durable. Plugged multiple devices to it. Phone, watch charger, iPad. Wished I had bought more.
Seems to be of good quality and worked well for me in Europe (even used it for a hairdryer and a  straightener I brought from the US and and had no issues.) it’s a bit heavier than I imagined but nothing too crazy
I got this as a charger that isn't something to expensive for international flights. I tend to go to visit my family every once in a while.I'm glad this thing has a built in USB-c port which guarantees fast charging. But the complimentary thing, which I didn't ask for. But glad it is present. Is the USB- C to USB -adapter module that plugs in.You see there are 4 USB- A ports. The product comes with two usb a-c adapters. In case you've replaced all your old cables with USB-c.This thing really can charge multiple things. I got an laptop, two phones what have you and it is a workhorse!
I used the EPICKA Universal Travel Adapter on my trip to Greece and London, and it was a lifesaver! The adapter worked flawlessly in both countries, handling different plug types without any issues. It's compact, easy to use, and also comes with USB ports, which are super convenient for charging multiple devices at once. The build quality is solid, ensuring it can withstand the rigors of travel. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to travel without worrying about charging issues!
We recently toured the UK, Holland, and Belgium and found these to be perfect for our travels. First, understand that these are not voltage converters. There is no 220v to 120v (or vice versa) conversions. If you use the outlet part of this device you must plug in something that can use either 120 and 220v as input. With that said, practically everything today requires a USB charger and these have 5 (4 USB 2.0s and one USB 3.0)! More than enough for phones, cameras, watches, selfie sticks etc. They are well made, and come with a nice carry case to protect from miscellaneous dust & food particles getting in the plug openings. They also come with additional fuses, if by chance you should need one.  Highly recommended.
I took this on a trip to Europe, and it was great!  It's small, has 4 USB chargers (which I used mostly anyway) . Great choice!.
I haven't used it on 220 VAC yet, but the USB chargers work great on on 120 VAC. It is cleverly designed for easily adapting to a variety of foreign sockets. Simply manually slide out the prongs for the socket you are faced with and plug it into the socket. After unplugging the adapter push the square button on the side of the unit to retract the prongs you had been using. Contains four Type A USB chargers and one type C USB charger plus two Type USB-A to USB-C adaptors. Please note that the charging current at each USB-A port is limited to 5V at 2.4A, the USB-C port is limited to 5V at 3A. The total DC charging output from all 5 USB ports combined is limited to 5V at a total of 5.6A so slower charging can be expected if all USB ports are used. Supports AC loads up to 1000W at 100V and up to 2400 W at 240 VAC. The AC adapter passes through the the voltage and frequency provided at the wall plate. IT DOES NOT CONVERT FOREIGN AC POWER TO MEET NORTH AMERICAN AC STANDARDS! Check your appliances to be sure they will work at the voltage and frequency present in the countries you intend to use this with. Many recent appliances such as cell phones, Pads, Chargers, Laptops, radios do work with international AC power standards but only come with one plug type.
Fall of 2023 my daughter moved from the States to England to get her masters degree.  I purchased one of these for her to use while she was there.  My daughter reported that it worked very well for her and she is still using it.  This summer, 2024, I went to visit her in London.  I purchased 2 more of these for me and my wife to use on our trip.  We’re back now and I can attest that it works perfectly.  I personally plugged in my CPAP into it.  I used one of the 4 USB chargers to charge my iPhone and used the USB-C charger to charge my MacBook. All at the same time and I didn’t have to fool with changing the voltage on anything i plugged into it.
What's to like: *Worldwide functionality. *All plugs are on the device, no need to keep track of various attachments. *The various plugs are retractable so they don't get bent while packed tight in your bag. *Carrying case for additional protection. *Additional fuses included too?! Man, that's pretty cool. Just keep them in the mini carrying case. *4 USB Type A ports is a helluva lot better than 2. Even if you don't need them all yourself, it's also super handy when there's not enough outlets to go around for all travelers (i.e. European hostels). *USB Type C for your fanciest devices.Now that I have this, I'll never need another travel adapter again. And BONUS: after getting home from my trip, I just plugged it into the wall and am using full time as a regular at-home charger as well!
I'm going to be honest, I really bought this simply for the pink on it. But not only does it have pink, which is my favorite color, it actually works. I went on a Viking River cruise and needed an adapter for the ship, but also one for some hotels in Romania and Hungary. This covered it all. Great item and took up very little space. Very happy with this purchase.
Good idea - like all the options for charging.  Unfortunately we purchased this in advance of our trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and the return date occurred while we were gone.  From the 1st night the plug to the wall was not snug; it required us propping it up with a box of tissue and a book.  At first we thought it could be a problem with the wall outlet vs. the converter itself.  However, we stayed in 6 different rentals and it was the same in each.  In fact - the more often we used the converter the looser it felt in the wall outlet.  By the time we were at our final destination we had to balance it on books plus a few of our small travel bags which was a bit of a safety concern having items so close to the outlet/converter.I'm disappointed - I should have tried it out before we left but it was a mad rush to get things wrapped up with work and life before we left for our 3 week trip.**UPDATE: 5 /30/24 -The company that makes EPICKA provides outstanding customer service.  Following my feedback on Amazon a representative reached out to troubleshoot.  After communicating with me re: our challenges with their product the representative sent out a replacement power adapter.  Although we have returned to the US and are unable to test the plug that is used in Cambodia/Vietnam, the device does plug in well with US outlets and the other charging plug ins work as well (USB, C, regular pronged devices, etc).I appreciate a company that stands by its products and provides excellent customer service.Thank you Angelia for your help!
I had one of these for 4 years and never had a problem. I gave it to my daughter and so I bought a new one. I had an issue with the new one getting stuck on a certain outlet and so I reached out to their customer service team and they quickly sent a replacement within a week of contacting them. I love this team and this product!
After 3-4 yrs of Use-  Blew out a Hair Dryer and then later a currling Iron, simply doesnt have a good circuit protection, aft 3-4 yrs of using.Chaged my rating - see belowNOT A VOLTAGE CONVERTER - This universal power adapter does not convert voltage and may not be suitable for use with high-power appliances like hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, and other similar devices. Max Power: 880W at 110V, 1920W at 240V.
Very affordable and convenient option for our first trip to Europe. I have a CPAP and this adapter allowed me to use one outlet to power my CPAP and charge my cellphone. The outlets at the AirBnB's we stayed at were limited, so this was a huge plus!
I got this for my trip to Germany this summer and it was just what I needed. It has 6 ports, and came with USB-C adapters, so there is plenty of space for 2 people to share.
I purchased 2 of these for a trip. Both worked great - especially because we were traveling to different countries which needed different adapters. This covered all the bases and came with a case for each one. Highly recommend!
Just used this over four weeks in Europe. Absolute must have and came in super handy when we unexpectedly added England to our trip! Nice case with it and enough ports (four usb and on usb-c) that I could charge my phone, eye mask, AirPods, iPad, and power bank each night. HIGHLY recommend.
I was hesitant to purchase this for my trip to Italy because I wasn't sure about the voltage difference with the USB. Turns out after doing some research, USB is 5v worldwide (the info on the product was limited). This was a great purchase it worked great for us, allowing us to charge multiple phones at once. Compact, lite, great purchase
Edit. I had some issues with the original adapter. I was at a hotel in the UK and upon plugging in a power strip with nothing else connected, it blew the fuse, tripped the breaker and destroyed the power strip. I replaced the fuse and used the adapter without a power strip. So why 4 stars? It was originally 1, but customer service really stepped up without me even asking them to. They sent me a new, upgraded version of the adapter and refunded me the cost of the old one which helped offset the cost of replacing the power strip. The new adapter seems to work fine. Granted I am back in the U.S. so I could only test that portion of it and I was sweating bullets when I plugged in my new and very expensive power strip, but it seems fine. Would I recommend it? I would. Despite everything that happened the customer service alone warrants purchasing from this vendor.
This adapter was crucial on my trip to europe. It worked in Italy , Greece , England , and France. I love that it had an outlet and usb-c port.
I had an old travel adapter for the trip but then I saw this model on a YouTube video. It can be plugged in to plugs in the US, UK and Europe.Why get a new one? Easy answer. This charger has 5 plugs for your electronic devices. 4 USB ports on the bottom, plus a USB type C on the side and this does not even include the 110V output. On my trip I was able to plug in my Cpap machine and also charge 2 iphones, 2 ipads and an apple watch all at the same time. The old adapter went to Goodwill. I was VERY happy with this for my two week trip to Italy, Hungary, Austria and Germany. One small point, I believe this company also makes a version that includes a wall plug for power in Australia, so check that out if your travel goes down under.
Used this on a recent trip to Europe and work well with all my devices. I did not need anything else to adjust the voltage differences so I was very happy with that.
I went to Ireland and it worked great with the charge slots and the 1 plug. I did not use it with a hair dryer but did use it for a very small (travel-sized) hot iron.I am even using it at home in the US as it has given me extra charging slots on a kitchen desk and on my bathroom vanity. (I liked the one so much I ordered two!)My only suggestion is to make sure the item is really plugged in as it can creep its way out of an outlet and not charge your phone and you don't want that type of surprise of an uncharged device.Still, a good value overall.
My vacation would have been a bust without this traveling to France. I had no idea what to expect, but with this multifaceted international charger, I was able to have ease and comfort, knowing that regardless of where I am, I would have means to power, my electronics and that alone is a blessing. This was reasonably priced and efficient
I was disappointed with this plug adapter and charger, but it is my fault for not reading the item's full description.  I bought this to use it for both domestic and overseas travel for all of my needs.  It turns out I can't use this for my hair dryer or hair straightener.  So, if you need this device to work with a hair dryer or hair straightener I don't recommend this adapter because it will blow the fuse.  When I reached out to Epicka customer service they responded quickly and resolved my issue, pointing me toward another adapter that can handle a higher-wattage device.  I'm giving this 5 stars because of the customer service.
I like this device. it was easy use and I could plug it in anywhere in the hotels and had lots of plugs for me. Only bad thing was I lost it during my vacation fell out of my backpack. I plan on getting another but next time I will put it in a bag that won't fall out.
It is compact, has everything you need and fits in a pocket. I liked it so much I bought another one for my mom.
This was perfect for my trip to the UK! The universal adapter is for use worldwide, so this is a great investment if you are in a coffee shop or hotel room overseas.
I have a trip coming up to Hong Kong and purchased this for their ports. This feels like it's price, cheap, the materials feel flimsy and the locks don't work that secure. But I am happy for this purchase since it was pretty affordable and gets the job done.
I bout this with an extension cord product. Happy with purchase and not as bulky as my other adapt and travel power kit. Be sure to push in side button to close the prongs! Great amount of usbs.
I LOVE THIS.  I loved this so much that i bought 2!!  There are so many ports.  Unbelievable.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Great product. Has all options for world travel. Even has adapters for the newer iPhone style plugs to connect to the USB ports.
Worked great in Switzerland, France, Budapest and Prague.  Was able to charge IPhone, IWatch and runssmall fan from the same plug.
Be sure that your devices are marked to allow the voltage and frequency of the power being connected as this does not convert power.
Bought two of these for our Japan trip. Nearly returned them bit luckily kept them and they came in real handy as they have multiple USB ports for charging. They will come in handy in other countries.
2.5 year review.This is my favorite travel adapter and the one I recommend to friends first. Exceptions below.I've now put this thru the wringer (as well as lending it out) and it's been to 14 countries. All three plug adapters (EU/UK/AUS) have been used and they've all functioned as intended. Easily charge multiple devices (mostly battery packs, power banks) overnight. The only issue I've had was a worn outlet in France, but that wasn't the fault of adapter. Moved the adapter to a different outlet and it worked fine.There are newer 'white box' models available with USB-C w/ PD and if you need to power a laptop without the power block for example, this one won't quite cut it. I now carry a 2nd adapter (ReMech usb-c) as a spare on longer trips or when I'm w/ a group to lend out, if I have space.
So far this little guy has been to Italy, Portugal, Austria and Czech Republic and worked great! Highly recommend!
It not only offers charging, but also offers different plug inputs when traveling. I knocked a star, because australian plug input does not work.
Worked great in Ireland and Scotland.  Had all the right connection options.  Buy this.  It's great!
I purchased this for my elderly mom for her travels. Once I explained how to use it, she had no issues when traveling overseas. Hopefully she'll be able to use it in other countries in the future. I recommend.
We just got back from a trip to Europe and I had bought 3 of these right before we left. They saved the day! They worked in every city and Airbnb we visited and any train we were on. It is really nice to be able to plug in 4 different USB-A items, one USB-C and something in the regular front outlet if needed. Can’t beat the price and the performance.
There were enough port spots for myself and others who brought inferior adapters with them.
Connection is lose it can fall out of wall. Also one of the sliders doesn’t click and lock. So it’s sloppy. Versatile. Don’t forget this does NOT step down voltage (you need an adapter for that).
Travelled to Europe and Africa. Did not disappoint. Would buy again for family members.
Did what we needed! Provided ability to use power in a bunch of countries.  AND, love that it had multiple USB ports too!
I have been using this adapter for a while and it really met my expectations.Also, I bought an extra for my parents.
Worked great! Used it in Austria, Czech, Switzerland, and Germany with zero problems. Comes with a nice little carrying case too.
Nice little adapter for the countries I'm most likely to visit. Haven't used for traveling yet, but at home it does get quite warm when charging my phone. Haven't tried it with multiple electronics yet.I was a little disappointed that it seems to no longer come with the lightning/micro USB cable that was mentioned in some previous reviews (because I'm stuck in the Stone Age and still have several electronics that use micro USB instead of USB-C), but it does apparently now come with two USB-A to USB-C adapters, which is probably more useful for people who actually live in 2024.
We took this to Europe on a trip. We were able to use it in different countries, airports (when we had layovers) and in our hotel. It was easy to charge all our devices, especially when there were limited outlets where we were staying. The case keeps it clean and nice. It’s not bulky or heavy.
This was a lifesaver during our trip to France and England.  We could charge 4 phones and a battery pack at the same time. Well priced. Very pleased.
Easy to learn - easy to use.
Travel frequently, have several different converter plugs. This is the best. Heads up if you want it to run your hair dryer it has 1920 watts max, Look thru this brand and find one that works for you. Great manufacture/brand.
It worked very well for me on my trips. You can use it in many different ways.
Muy buen producto, muy útil por sus diversos puntos de conexión, el estuche le da un plus.
I have to travel with a CPAP machine. This unit worked great in Rome and Athens, but in the UK, which is a different plug type, I could not use my CPAP machine as it required an active ground. The ground piece for the UK is plastic in this unit.
Worked perfectly in many countries with daily use for 1 year, then USB-C and AC socket stopped working. I emailed EPICKA and per their limited warranty, they quickly mailed me a new one without any shipping charge or cost to myself. Easiest warranty replacement process I've dealt with. Only slight annoyance is that its large size blocks you from using the other AC wall socket if you need it.
So happy I took this on our trip to UK and Europe.Charged phones perfectlyWorked well in the hotelsHotels did not have any USB plugs
This adapter has 5 usb ports (4 usb-a and 1 usb-c) so that you won't need a usb charger while on the road. It also adapts between most any outlet style to most any other outlet style. One thing is does not do, convert 240 V to 120 V! If you are going to use devices with this, they need to be able to run on the local voltage.
Light weight, small, universal, 4 usb ports. Perfect little adapter. I've had mine around two years with no issues.
I love this adapter.  I already had the smaller one with 2 usb ports but having one with 4 is even better.  Highly recommend.
great product, used all around for traveling.had a problem and customer support helped me replace the fuse. surprised with their quick response and helpfulness
To the UK and back, and for my needs this performed very well. Used mainly for phone and computer charging using USB-C cable without a glitch.
took it to Australia and used it there, it's nice because it can be used in other countries along with USA, quite versatile . Has names of countries you move the switch to align with that place and the plug that works there pops out.  quite simple to use.
I bought 2 and they worked perfectly, from the UK to Belgium. Thanks
I am going to Europe in the fall, I bought 2 of these cause I have couple of electronics that would take up more than the couple usb ports… great to have..
UPDATE: after posting the review below, the seller promptly reached out with an offer of a refund and a chance to try out an updated version of the adapter with new electronics. That's way above and beyond!As a plug converter plugged into an AC outlet it's decent and the USB ports are very convenient. However, if you are using it in conjunction with a battery / inverter be aware that the power conversion for the USB ports is *very* inefficient. We used this on a recent camping trip in Europe, while camping our power supply was a battery pack for a CPAP machine, the battery pack has 2 USB A and one USB C charging ports in addition to an AC outlet. Running the CPAP and charging 2 iPhones and a watch overnight would consume about 1/2 of the battery's capacity. When we added the EPICKA plug adapter so that we could charge 3 phones the battery drain was almost doubled -- since the plug adapter part shouldn't impose any load, it seems that the excess drain was due to the power conversion for the USB ports (and the third phone, but even with nothing plugged in to the USB ports there was a substantial drain.
My daugher bought one of these for her travels two summers ago and it's still going strong.  She's using it right now in the UK and throughout Europe.  I bought one for my recent Euro trip. I expect it to work fine.  As the instructions say, DO NOT use this for heavy voltage - hair dryers, curling irons, fans, etc.  It is meant only for electronics and USB charging.  It is also NOT a voltage converter.  Make sure your electronics have 100/240 designation.  Nearly all AC adapters do.
This works well
I recently had an incredible support experience with Katelin at Epicka. After several months of using the product, it was not working perfectly. I decided to write through the website, and Katelin quickly reached out to me via email, explaining in detail what to do. After following her instructions, the problem was solved. It was a quick and effective response. I completely recommend the product.
Compact and light wight. Worked perfectly in London, Paris, and Rome with all electronics, iphone. ipad, laptop.  Would recommend to anyone. :) Very happy with this purchase.
Better design than my previous power adapter!  Good quality as well.
I already have one of these so buying a second was a no brainer.  It has lots of usb ports and 1 c. The first, at least 5 years old, still works great.
Bought this travel adapter for our upcoming trip to Europe.  This one adapter will fit every country we're going to visit.  The USB ports on the bottom are the best feature.  No need to bring other UBS plugs.  It also came with extra fuses and adapters to plug is the smaller Apple USB's.  Great product.
Got this for deployment and it worked perfectly
I was traveling to Europe and needed a multipurpose charger.  This fit the bill perfectly.  This product offered my different options for charging phones and hearing aids.  I would strongly recommend this adapter.
This little gem worked everywhere! The EU wall outlets can be deep but the prongs on this adapter extend out far so it had no problems plugging in snugly. Super convenient to have 4 USB charging ports which were frequently all used simultaneously along with whatever two-pronged charger or device plugged into the front. We didn't bring a transformer of any sort yet everything we tried worked and charged fine and fast. Highly recommended!
A very compact adapter. Has plenty of plugs for solo traveler but perhaps not for 2 travelers with multiple devices to charge.
Used this the last 2 weeks for a trip to Georgia & Azerbaijan.  Had 4 usb cables plugged into it - a watch, 2 phones and a tablet.  charged like a charm.  i did not use my flat iron tho so can't speak to its capabilities with a hot/heating device.  love this, though; my travel companions want their own.
Worked very well on our trip to Cancun
Compact little guy!  I'm going to Italy, Switzerland & Ireland.  Three different electrical plugs.  This item should take care of all.  The pouch keeps the items secure.  I bought the pink cover so that it will stand out and have a less chance of leaving it behind while traveling.
I bought this for my overseas travel, as it can accommodate both the UK and EU. It also serves as a charging bock which can charge several devices at once. It worked well and was able to charge both phones and the tablet. One small complaint is that the output sockets are on the bottom which can be inconvenient in some circumstances. It's a small issue.
This is a must have! Supports multiple country usage, and with the USB support, very versatile! Even in the Airport, anywhere in the world. Again a must have!!
This does what it purports to do in a modest sized package and, importantly these days, provides not only a way to access power from a foreign outlets but multiple USB slots to deliver it to your devices.
I just wanted to be able to charge all of our devices when we're overseas.
I have traveled quite a bit over the last few years and have struggled with the electrical adapters. It seems like I would never have the right one and would have to borrow from the Concierge. This adapter has solved all my problems. It works and both Great Britain And multiple countries in Europe, without the name for any additional converters or adapters, I highly recommend it
I had to replace my old school adapter, and this worked out really well for my husband and me. We had multiple devices to charge and this adapter made it easy and got the job done. The design is ingenious.
This product was great for traveling. I have a couple of the cheap ones you get from target/Walmart and they don’t work nearly as well as this. You can charge multiple items either through the plug in or the USB without slowing down the speed. Definitely good value for the money.
I heard about this on the news and the reviews that was stated.  I had to try it for myself, and yes, it does the job even when not traveling!!
It’s sturdy, doesn’t take up too much space (though it is bulky), and will cover your bases for most of your travels around the globe. The additional USB slots are a welcome addition, though with most devices shifting to USB-C, I hope the design changes to have two type C ports in the future. Not a huge deal for the time being, but would be a welcome change within the next year or two.
Easy to use, multiple plug styles, and 4 USB ports for charging devices. I used it every night in Iceland and England for my CPAP machine.
Used in Europe and on cruise.  No issues and very happy that it had so many USB ports to charge everyone's phones and earbuds
I recently took a trip for business and this charger work exactly as expected. It charged my phone and my power bank with no issues. I would recommend this product! I was able to fit this in my backpack to bring it on the airplane with no issues.
I wish I had purchased two of these.  Bought a cheap one in Spain because I needed another and it wasn't snug in the outlet.  This stayed put and didn't wiggle at all.
love the usb c port it comes with along with other usbs that's makes things easier to charge without having to use a block
Packs up small in its leather case, saw me through Asia & Europe.
For our recent South Korea travel I didn't know I needed a plug adapter, after searching and searching I found this UNIVERSAL plug adapter. It worked perfectly fine in our hotel room. It has USB plugs, USB-C, USA plugs, Europe, and Asia. A must-have item when traveling!
Recently purchased this for international travel. Tried it out on a short domestic trip.  It saves space packing as you can plug in 4 usb cords as well as 1 usb-c.  Or in my case bought a couple of adapters for usb to usbc.Worked perfectly in USA. It is very well designed.
This adapter was a lifesaver when we recently traveled through Europe.  It worked well in every country, and was very handy because we could charge several devices at once.  Highly recommended!
Post travel review: I used this on an international trip traveling to both the UK, France, and Italy. It worked perfectly in all locations. I especially liked that it had four USB ports, a USB-C port, plus a regular US outlet. This is not a power converter. It is only an adapter, But most electronics are already dual voltage. It is small and packed easily. Highly recommend.
I've had this for about a year now. I haven't used it often. It no longer works from the main port, and only works from the USB side ports. This is causing me a lot of issues because I trusted it to work.I've been careful with it, it just no longer works. Seems like I got a defective unit. Beware
The product is defective, none of the trouble shooting information available is accurate to this device or helpful. Also, the website link for the manufacturer for further support or warranty issues is not active, and you will be sent back to Amazon’s website.
It didn't work in Europe. By the time I returned from my month long trip the return window had closed.
Purchased to use on my Europe vacation. Plugged it in, plugged my hair dryer and it shorted out. Would not recommend 😕
It worked for my phone and my computer in Italy, but it gave the computer a charge, so every timeI touched the computer when it was plugged in, it gave me a small shock. I worried it might hurt the computer, but I kept using it for two weeks, as I had no immediate alternative. Both the computer and I survived, but I consider the thing to be defective and am returning it.
Nice appearance, packaging, with little case.  Unfortunately, not functional for devices that have a third prong on plug, like charging a laptop.
The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    








  
  
    Great travel adapter for traveling across the U.S. and Europe. Inexpensive and easy to use
I bought this for my trip to China.  The unit itself worked great.  I gave it 3 starts because the balance is off so it kept falling out of the wall socket.  I had to put something under the adapter so that it wouldn't fall out of the wall.  This was frustrating but I was able to work around it while I was there.
Works great!
We used this traveling to London. Our first use, plugged in our little white noise maker and went to bed. About five minutes later, we noticed the noise cut off and then a very strong smell. The noise maker motor was shot and the smell was coming from the burnt out motor!
Flexible, compact, and a truly univesal adapter.
My blow dryer broke because of the adapter. Out of 3 I bought only one worked. I replaced the fuses and they did not work.
Concept is great but it takes up the entire outlet
I just returned from a 3-week trip to Spain. I am glad that I bought this item and would recommend it because of the 4 USB ports that it includes. BUT I am only giving it 3 stars because it ALONE did not work for me. When I tried to use it at hotels throughout Spain, it usually did not stay tight in the socket, and would tend to fall out. To correct this problem while I was in Madrid, I bought the white adapter shown in the photo. It works perfectly with this adapter, which was easy to find in electronics stores in Madrid (though I’d recommend purchasing it in advance if you can find it!).Using these two adapters combined, I was able to charge all my devices (cell phone, watch, tablet) and I was also able to use my dual-voltage flat iron and clothes steamer.
Great adapter for 2 week trip, no complaints (does not convert voltage).
Used it in Amsterdam, Dublin, Paris, India, Nepal, London, Munich and London -- this is a great product. Small and works everywhere.
Small and effective charger.
Easy to travel with and handle all your needs including mobile devices
I haven't used it yet.  You need to read the directions first before using.
Just received looks goodWill use for travel to Europe
I love it, it’s a life saver
Used recently and it performed well. Sturdy and makes a solid connection between plug and outlet. Comes with a nice zip up case.
We bought this for our trip to Europe & it did not work. Past our return window since we bought it ahead of our trip.
The price n quality is good
Just what I needed!
Easy to use
Producto muy practico para viajar, tiene un tamaño adecuado y no es pesado.La carga es rápida.
The all of the usb ports are crazy slow and take atleast 3 hours for phones to charge from 0. Product comes with a nice travel case with 2 usb-a to usb-c adapters and 3 fuses. It works as intended though.
Excelente y útil
Recently used the outlet adapter and it worked flawlessly.
We are older travelers who certainly are not up on new technology.  This will make it possible to charge our phones when away from home
Una decepcion, viajo el lunes, y compre este enchufe por que supuestamente tenia puertos USB y el mas chiquito para el Ipad, y ninguno funciona. Como enchufe si, pero para USB no….
